    This HTML file demonstrates the use of GET and POST HTTP methods through simple forms.

    Understanding GET and POST Requests:

    1. GET Method:
       - The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.
       - When a form uses method="get", the form data is appended to the URL as query parameters.
         For example: /register?user=example&pass=1234
       - This means the data is visible in the browser's address bar.
       - GET requests can be cached, remain in the browser history, and can be bookmarked.
       - Because data is sent in the URL, it is limited in length and should not be used for sensitive information.
       - GET requests are idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.

    2. POST Method:
       - The POST method is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
       - When a form uses method="post", the form data is sent inside the HTTP request body.
       - This makes the data not visible in the URL, providing a bit more privacy.
       - POST requests are not cached by default and do not remain in browser history or bookmarks.
       - There is no size limitation like in GET, so it is suitable for sending large amounts of data.
       - POST requests are not idempotent; multiple identical requests may result in multiple resource changes.

    Security and Use Cases:
    - GET should be used for retrieving data or performing actions that do not change server state.
    - POST should be used for submitting sensitive data (like passwords) or when the operation changes server state.
    - Since GET appends data to the URL, sensitive information may be exposed in browser history or server logs.
    - POST is preferred for sensitive data transmission but does not inherently encrypt data; HTTPS should be used for secure transmission.

    Summary:
    - Use GET to fetch data and POST to submit data.
    - Data sent via GET is visible in the URL; data sent via POST is in the request body.
    - Choose the method based on the nature of the operation and sensitivity of the data.
